- **File Selection**: Users can select exactly two PDF files for merging.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error message if the user does not select exactly two PDF files.
- **Success Notification**: Notifies the user upon successful merging of the selected PDF files.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter
- PyPDF2

## Installation

Before running the program, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

After installing Python, you need to install the `PyPDF2` library. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install PyPDF2
